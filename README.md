## Project's Background

**Background:**

Tornadoes, often referred to as nature's most violent storms, have always been a subject of concern and intrigue. From 1950 to 2022, the USA witnessed an enormous number of tornado cases, making it imperative to understand their patterns, intensity, and the affected regions for better preparedness.

**Problem Statement:**

Tornadoes are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing both loss of life and significant economic damage. Over the years, the United States has seen a considerable number of tornado occurrences. However, there remains a limited consolidated analysis that illuminates the broader patterns, economic impacts, and trends related to these events. Understanding these patterns is pivotal for better preparedness, targeted relief efforts, and developing efficient early warning systems.

## Datasets

**Dataset Overview:**

- Dataset Source: This dataset is obtained from the Kaggle public dataset
- This dataset covering tornado events across the USA spanning over seven decades (1950 to 2022). With almost 70,000 recorded tornado cases, this dataset provides invaluable insights into the temporal and spatial patterns of these formidable natural events.

## Objectives

The primary aim of this repository is to share insights derived from the dataset, offer data-driven narratives on tornado patterns, and provide a robust technical solution for similar large-scale data analysis endeavors.

### Key Findings

- State Most Affected: Texas emerges as the state most affected by tornadoes. Its geographical location and vast expanse contribute to this heightened susceptibility.
- Economic Impact: The average economic loss due to tornadoes per state stands at approximately $2.8 billion, highlighting the substantial financial burden these events can inflict.
- Tornado Seasonality: A discernible 'tornado season' exists, typically extending from April to June every year. This season is marked by an uptick in tornado occurrences, necessitating extra caution and preparedness during these months.
- Trends Over Time: There's an observable upward trend in tornado cases over the years. This trend might be influenced by various factors, including climatic changes, better recording practices, or a combination of multiple aspects.
- Magnitude Analysis: The majority of tornadoes recorded in the dataset are of magnitude 0. While this signifies that most tornadoes are of lower intensity, it's essential to remember that even lower magnitude tornadoes can cause significant damage and pose threats to life and property.
